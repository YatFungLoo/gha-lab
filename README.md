# GitHub Actions Lab
Implementation of continuous integration of GitHub as part of the MSc course. Using GitHub free CI service called Actions, for public repositories.

GHA detects and responds to changes made to code of files held within repositories on GitHub. GHA is a remote service hence user can continue working on while tests are under way.

This lab will be around a simple "Hello World!" python program.
